1st iOS project - Number Guesser Game

This iOS app chooses a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The user has 5 trials to guess the number. If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the app will respond with a message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number and vice versa. If the guessed number is correct or if the 5 trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.
